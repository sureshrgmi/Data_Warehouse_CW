#### Task Background

The main requirement of this task was to create a Data Warehouse solution along with a Macjine Learning implementation based on certain use case scenario. The deliverables of this task were a Dara Warehouse (Designed using Star Schema), SQL queries to create the warehouse system, Python script for the machine learning implementation and the list of reporting queries based on the requirements.



### ERD for the Data Warehouse Design

For this step, a Star Schema was designed based on the project requirement. Fact and dimentional modelling were done on the bassis of the data present and the requirement of the project. [Link](ERD_001204526_Group_11.pdf)

### DDL to create the DW tables

After designing the fact and dimension tables, the tables were created in the data warehouse usign the following scripts. [Link](DWH_Table_AND_Sequences_Creation_DDL.sql)

### Loading Data into the Warehouse

Once the database objects were created, the data was cleansed and loaded into the data warehouse system. [Link](Loading_Data_To_Warehouse.sql)

### Machine Learning Implementation usign Decision Tree Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier was used to perform the prediction on the type of covers. [Link](COMP-1848_Decision_Tree_001204526.ipynb)

### Reporting Queries

Basic reporting on the data from the data warehouse was done to extract some information. [Link](GroupTaskQuries.sql)
